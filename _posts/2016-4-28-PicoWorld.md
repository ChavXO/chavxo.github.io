title: Picoworld: A 3D version of PicoBot
---

For my Graphics final project I decided to make a 3D version of my first Colgate assignment - Picobot.
It practically works much the same as the normal [Picobot](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/picobot/). 

[Here]({{ site.url }}/picoworld/index.html) is the link to the project. Enjoy.
