[with version 0.0.2 is out](https://github.com/mchav/with)

I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by the uptake of the with tool. I was even more surprised by the community that started to build around it. The contributions have been invaluable. The new version brings some new changes thanks to kalterfive and dragonator.

* with now supports tab completion
* the history from a with session now goes into your bash history as a complete command.
* you can customise the prompt colour.

There are still some milestones I'd like to start working on for newer versions, such as:

* running a script or command when a file is changed, and,
* a lot more flexible prompt customisation.

Thank you to everyone who has supported with and has contributed to it.
